                                Non-disclosure agreements are standard practice in the technology industry, especially during the early stages of a product’s lifespan. The product itself is the embodiment of our company’s intellectual property, and so to avoid it being shared with parties who could damage our business, we ask all our users (customers included) to sign the non-disclosure agreement. Unfortunately, if a user refuses to sign the non-disclosure agreement, we cannot work with them.

                                No, Crewpoints will initially make money by charging restaurants or other brick-and-mortar businesses for access to the software to request service(s). In the future we may explore other business models, including charging the restaurants an administration or handling fee for service requests, or other business models we have not yet considered. If and when we implement changes like this to our business model, we will inform you immediately and you will have the ability to reconsider whether you wish to continue being listed as a vendor on Crewpoints.

                                Should this arise, we do expect that both the vendor and customer communicate with us openly and transparently about this - so that we can learn about how we can improve our products and services in order to better serve the market. We have not created Crewpoints to restrict or impinge operators in the industry from doing business together - instead, we aspire to serve the market and make it easier for them to do business together.

                                Crewpoints is a tool used by our customers (initially restaurants) to run the back-end of their businesses efficiently. The tool has a portal that allows restaurants to book reactive repair/maintenance work with a select group of high-quality vendors.

                                For vendors, it means that in the short-term you’ll have an extra stream of job opportunities. In the long-term, you have the opportunity to build long-lasting, high-quality relationships with forward-thinking, professional restaurants, and potentially expand your customer base beyond the industries of restaurants and other food-service locations, if and when we bring those industries onto Crewpoints.

                                The Crewpoints product is currently in the ‘Beta’ phase of its lifespan. That means it is not yet available to the public, because we are still developing it to be ready for the wider market. Naturally, that means that the product may have bugs or unexpected problems. It also means that the product might not do exactly what users want it to do in order to make their lives easier, save them time and/or money, and so on.

                                From time to time, we will ask you to provide feedback either through the form of user interviews or user surveys. The topics of these feedback requests will change, as the direction of the product development changes. We ask you to be as honest and truthful in your feedback as possible - we’re equally interested in hearing about the things that you don’t like, as well as the things that you do like.

                                We will take the feedback you provide to us and directly address it to improve the product - so any feedback that you provide will contribute to a better user experience for you in the future.

                                Non-disclosure agreements are standard practice in the technology industry, especially during the early stages of a product’s lifespan. The product itself is the embodiment of our company’s intellectual property, and so to avoid it being shared with parties who could damage our business, we ask all our users (customers included) to sign the non-disclosure agreement. Unfortunately, if a user refuses to sign the non-disclosure agreement, we cannot work with them.

                                As a restaurant, you have several options to find the most suitable service vendors for your service work. It’s important to make the distinction that Crewpoints IS NOT a marketplace platform for service work. In contrast to online marketplaces available, Crewpoints is a tool that allows restaurants to create a scalable, powerful facilities management playbook. This playbook ensures you can keep up with your brands’ growth. Effectively, Crewpoints allows you to operate as your own ‘general contractor’, or neatly integrate into the general contractor partners also using Crewpoints.

                                At Crewpoints, we are selective about the vendors that we invite onto the platform. If a vendor does not want to use the platform, we encourage you to make a simple introduction to our team - we will perform our vetting process to ascertain if this vendor is of a high enough quality to be on the platform. If our vetting suggests that the vendor is not of a high enough quality, we will inform you and present you with some alternatives.

                                Crewpoints is a tool used by our customers (restaurants) to run the back-end of their businesses efficiently. The tool has a portal that allows restaurants to book reactive repair/maintenance work with a select group of high-quality vendors.
